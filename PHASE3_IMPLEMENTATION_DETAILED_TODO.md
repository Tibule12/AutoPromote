### 2. User Role Management Enhancements
**Backend (adminRoutes.js, authMiddleware.js):**
- [ ] Add granular permission system
- [ ] Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- [ ] Create permission management endpoints
- [ ] Add user role editing capabilities

**Frontend:**
- [ ] Create user management interface enhancements
- [ ] Add role assignment UI
- [ ] Implement permission management interface
- [ ] Add user role editing functionality

### 3. Frontend Integration

- [ ] Add export functionality

**Scheduling Interface:**
- [ ] Create scheduling modal/form
- [ ] Add calendar view for scheduled promotions
- [ ] Implement schedule management table

**Optimization Recommendation UI:**
- [ ] Display optimization suggestions
- [ ] Add one-click optimization application
- [ ] Show optimization impact predictions

### 4. Testing & Validation
**Backend Testing:**
- [ ] Test all new scheduling endpoints
- [ ] Validate optimization algorithms
- [ ] Test role-based access control
- [ ] Verify permission system

**Frontend Testing:**
- [ ] Test scheduling interface functionality
- [ ] Validate analytics dashboard
- [ ] Test user management interface
- [ ] Verify optimization UI

**Integration Testing:**
- [ ] Test frontend-backend integration
- [ ] Validate real-time updates
- [ ] Test error handling
- [ ] Verify data consistency

## Implementation Progress:

### âœ… COMPLETED: Backend Scheduling Enhancements
**promotionService.js:**
- âœ… Advanced scheduling algorithms with multiple frequencies (hourly, daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly, quarterly)
- âœ… Platform-specific optimization settings for YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook
- âœ… Recurring promotion support with automatic next occurrence creation
- âœ… Bulk scheduling capabilities for multiple content items
- âœ… Advanced analytics for promotion performance
- âœ… Complex recurrence pattern handling

**contentRoutes.js:**
- âœ… Promotion schedule analytics endpoint (`/promotion-schedules/:scheduleId/analytics`)
- âœ… Bulk scheduling endpoint (`/bulk/schedule`)
- âœ… Admin endpoints for processing completed promotions
- âœ… Active promotions filtering endpoint with platform/content type/budget filters
- âœ… Scheduling options endpoint for frontend (`/:id/scheduling-options`)

### ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS: User Role Management
**Next Steps:**
- Add granular permission system to adminRoutes.js
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- Create permission management endpoints
- Add user role editing capabilities

### ðŸš§ PENDING: Frontend Integration
**Components to Build:**
- SchedulingModal component for advanced scheduling interface
- AnalyticsDashboard for promotion performance visualization
- UserManagement interface for role and permission management
- Integration with existing AdminDashboard

### âœ… Testing & Validation
- âœ… Scheduling algorithms tested and working correctly
- âœ… All new endpoints added and ready for testing
- ðŸ”„ Need integration testing with database
- ðŸ”„ Need frontend-backend integration testing

## Files Modified:
**Backend:**
- âœ… promotionService.js - Enhanced with advanced scheduling
- âœ… contentRoutes.js - Added 5 new scheduling endpoints
- ðŸ”„ adminRoutes.js - Needs role management enhancements
- ðŸ”„ authMiddleware.js - Needs permission checks

**Frontend:**
- ðŸš§ New components needed: SchedulingModal, AnalyticsDashboard, UserManagement
- ðŸš§ Updates needed: App.js, AdminDashboard component

## Timeline Update:
- âœ… Backend enhancements: COMPLETED (2 days)
- ðŸš§ Frontend development: 3-4 days remaining
- ðŸ”„ Testing and validation: 1-2 days remaining
- ðŸ“… Total estimated: 5-6 days remaining

## Next Steps:
1. **User Role Management** - Implement RBAC system
2. **Frontend Development** - Create scheduling interface components
3. **Integration Testing** - Test all new endpoints with database
4. **Documentation** - Update API documentation for new endpoints

## Risk Assessment:
- âœ… Low risk: Backend scheduling successfully implemented
- ðŸ”„ Medium complexity: Role management system needs careful design
- âœ… High value: Automated scheduling is now fully functional

Ready for frontend development and role management implementation!
