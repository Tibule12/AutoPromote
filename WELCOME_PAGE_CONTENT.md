**AutoPromote**
_Turn every upload into a smarter decision._

## What is AutoPromote?

AutoPromote is a content intelligence platform for creators and businesses who already publish content and want clearer signals before scaling it. Instead of blindly posting or promoting content everywhere, AutoPromote lets you run a controlled first publish, observe early performance, and improve presentation before wider amplification.

**AutoPromote helps creators test, learn, and improve content performance using real outcomes — not assumptions.**

## Core Philosophy

- Test before you scale
- Learn from real outcomes, not assumptions
- Improve presentation before amplification
- Every action requires explicit user consent
- Confidence comes from evidence, not promises

_AutoPromote does not guarantee virality. It guarantees smarter attempts and clearer learning._

## How It Works

_Every step is opt-in. Nothing is published, tested, or changed without user approval._

1. **Upload Once**: Users upload original content to AutoPromote and choose a single platform or limited audience for an initial test publish. _No mass distribution. No amplification. Just an early signal._
2. **Observe Performance**: The platform monitors early performance during a short observation window (typically 3–7 hours, depending on platform), focusing on initial engagement signals such as retention, interaction, and response velocity.
3. **Improve When Needed**: If content underperforms and the user has given consent, AutoPromote generates 1–2 optional AI-assisted variations focused on stronger hooks, better pacing, and platform-native formatting.
4. **Learn & Compare**: AutoPromote compares original performance against AI-assisted variations and provides clear, human-readable feedback. The goal is learning, not guessing.

## What AutoPromote Is NOT

- Not an ad platform
- Not a guarantee of reach or virality
- Not a replacement for creativity
- Not automation without permission

_AutoPromote is a learning and optimization layer built on top of existing platforms._

## User Trust & Consent

- No content is published without explicit user approval
- AI-assisted variations are optional and opt-in
- Testing and scheduling behavior is transparent
- All actions align with external platform policies

## Who AutoPromote Is For

AutoPromote is for creators and teams who:

- already publish content regularly
- want clearer feedback before scaling or boosting
- care about learning and consistency, not one-off virality

_It is not built for spam, mass posting, or shortcut growth._

## North Star Metric

_"Every upload should give the creator a better chance and a clearer lesson than the last one."_
