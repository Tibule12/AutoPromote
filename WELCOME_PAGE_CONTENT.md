**AutoPromote**
_Turn every upload into a smarter opportunity._

## What is AutoPromote?

AutoPromote is a content intelligence platform that helps creators and businesses **test, learn, and improve content performance before scaling it** across external platforms. Instead of blindly posting or promoting content, AutoPromote observes early performance, runs controlled improvements (AI clips), and delivers clear feedback so creators understand what actually works for their audience.

## Core Philosophy

- Test before you scale
- Learn from real outcomes, not assumptions
- Improve presentation before amplification
- Every action requires user consent
- Confidence comes from evidence, not promises

_AutoPromote does not guarantee virality. It guarantees smarter attempts and clearer learning._

## How It Works

1. **Upload Once**: Users upload their original content and select the platforms they want to publish to.
2. **Observe Performance**: The platform monitors early performance during a defined observation window.
3. **Improve When Needed**: If content underperforms and the user has given consent, AutoPromote generates 1–2 AI-optimized clips focused on stronger hooks, better pacing, and platform-native formatting.
4. **Learn & Compare**: AutoPromote compares original performance vs AI clips and provides clear, human-readable feedback.

## What AutoPromote Is NOT

- Not an ad platform
- Not a guarantee of reach
- Not a replacement for creativity
- Not automation without permission

_AutoPromote is a learning and optimization layer on top of existing platforms._

## User Trust & Consent

- No content is published without explicit user approval
- AI clips are optional and opt-in
- Scheduling and testing behavior is transparent
- All actions align with external platform policies

## North Star Metric

_"Every upload should give the creator a better chance and a clearer lesson than the last one."_
