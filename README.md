# AutoPromote

AutoPromote is a free, automated content promotion platform that helps creators distribute content across major platforms, drive traffic to monetized landing pages, and generate daily revenue. Phase 1 is built entirely with free and open‑source tools; premium features (VFX‑style enhancements, auto‑tune, realistic background replacement) will be phased in later as the platform scales.

## Vision

- Promote creator content for free across multiple platforms
- Route traffic to monetized landing pages you own (you keep 100% of AutoPromote revenue)
- Users retain 100% of any revenue they earn directly from external platforms (TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, etc.)

## MVP Features (Current Status)

### TikTok Developer Setup

Use these values in the TikTok Developer Console (App > Basic Info / OAuth):

- Official Website URL: https://Tibule12.github.io/AutoPromote
- Privacy Policy URL: https://Tibule12.github.io/AutoPromote/docs/privacy.html
- Terms of Service URL: https://Tibule12.github.io/AutoPromote/docs/terms.html
- Data Deletion URL: https://Tibule12.github.io/AutoPromote/docs/data-deletion.html
- Platform: Web
- Redirect URI: https://autopromote.onrender.com/api/tiktok/callback
- Scopes (initial): user.info.basic

Server env required (Render):

```
TIKTOK_CLIENT_KEY=...
TIKTOK_CLIENT_SECRET=...
TIKTOK_REDIRECT_URI=https://autopromote.onrender.com/api/tiktok/callback
2. Approve on TikTok, you’ll be redirected back to the dashboard with `?tiktok=connected`.
3. Tokens are stored at Firestore: `users/{uid}/connections/tiktok`.

Property verification (if requested):

- TikTok may provide one of two file names and token formats:
	1) `tiktok-verify.txt` with content like `tiktok-site-verification=xxxx`
	2) `tiktok-developers-site-verification.txt` with content like `tiktok-developers-site-verification=xxxx`
- If using GitHub Pages, place the file under: `docs/.well-known/` so it serves at:
	- `https://Tibule12.github.io/AutoPromote/.well-known/<file>`
- If using Render as your live domain, place the file under `public/.well-known/` (already mounted), so it serves at:
	- `https://<your-render-domain>/.well-known/<file>`
- Wait ~1–3 minutes after pushing, then click Verify in the TikTok console.

## Roadmap (near‑term)

## Key Analytics & Billing Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/metrics/dashboard/performance` | GET | Aggregate impressions, clicks, CTR, variant winners |
| `/api/metrics/content/:id/performance` | GET | Detailed variant performance & Wilson scores |
| `/api/metrics/content/:id/champion` | GET | Current champion variant + significance flag |
## Security Hardening (Recent)
- Environment validation (`envValidator`) with startup warnings & optional strict fail.
- Layered security headers (Helmet + custom: X-Frame-Options, XCTO, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy, COOP, CORP).
- Global token bucket rate limiter scaffold (pluggable backend; currently in-memory) on all `/api/` routes.
- JWT audience & issuer enforcement (optional via `JWT_AUDIENCE`, `JWT_ISSUER`).
- Webhook security: Stripe signature verification; PayPal RSA cert verification with cert caching.
- Document integrity signatures for queued promotion tasks (`docSigner` attaches `_sig`, verified before processing).
Planned Next Security Enhancements:
- Redis adapter for distributed rate limiting & user defaults cache.
- Automated security audit script summarizing posture & drift detection.
- Dead-letter replay tool with integrity verification preview.


## Backfill Script

Rebuild denormalized click counters from historical shortlink events:

```
node scripts/backfillClickCounters.js --dry   # preview
node scripts/backfillClickCounters.js         # apply
```

## Variant Ranking Method

Wilson lower bound (95% confidence) applied to CTR stabilizes rankings with low impressions.

Champion criteria:
- Minimum impressions threshold (default 30, override `?minImpressions=`)
- Champion lower bound strictly greater than runner-up lower bound OR large impression multiple.

## Overage Billing Flow

1. Enqueue checks plan quota.
2. Worker samples monthly tasks and computes overage.
3. Idempotent overage ledger insertion (ensures at most one record per excess task).

## Future Enhancements

- Daily rollup snapshots for long-range analytics
- Bayesian variant selection
- Stripe metered usage for overage events
- Websocket push for champion changes

## Payments Architecture (In-Review Mode)
While Stripe / PayPal accounts are still under review, the app exposes a unified status endpoint:

`GET /api/payments/status` -> `{ paymentsEnabled, payoutsEnabled, providers: { stripe:{...}, paypal:{...}, manual?:{...} } }`

Environment flags:
```
ALLOW_PAYMENTS_DEV_MOCK=false  # enable mock subscription/payout endpoints for local testing
ENABLE_MANUAL_PROVIDER=false   # adds a always-on dev provider
```

Dev mocks (when ALLOW_PAYMENTS_DEV_MOCK=true):
 - POST `/api/payments/dev/mock/subscription` { plan, amount }
 - POST `/api/payments/dev/mock/payout` { amount }

Provider abstraction lives under `src/services/payments/` (stripe, paypal placeholder, manual). This lets you finalize UI & balance logic before real credentials are active.

### Balance & Financial Endpoints (New)
 - `GET /api/payments/balance` (auth) provisional vs available (hold days) vs lifetime.
 - `GET /api/payments/plans` public plan catalog derived from env.
 - `GET /api/payments/admin/overview` (admin) 30-day revenue & payouts summary.
 - `POST /api/paypal/webhook` placeholder logging endpoint.
 - Reconciliation script: `node scripts/reconcilePayouts.js` marks stale processing payouts failed after `RECONCILE_PAYOUT_STALE_HOURS`.
 - Worker now periodically snapshots balances (probabilistic) to status docs.

```
ALLOW_LIVE_PAYMENTS=false
PAYOUT_HOLD_DAYS=7
STRIPE_PRICE_PRO=price_12345
STRIPE_PRICE_SCALE=price_67890
FREE_PLAN_QUOTA=50
Events emitted:
- `stripe.onboard.started`, `stripe.account.status`, `stripe.login_link.created`
```
firestore collection: audit_logs (order by at desc)

An in-memory limiter (`simpleRateLimit`) protects a few sensitive endpoints (values per process, reset on restart):
| POST /api/stripe/onboard | 5 |
| POST /api/stripe/account/login-link | 10 |
Daily aggregated metrics are stored in `content_daily_metrics` documents with id format `<contentId>_<YYYYMMDD>` capturing:

- posts: number of platform posts sampled that day
- impressions: sum of sampled impressions
- clicks: total shortlink resolves attributed that day
- variants: per variant string breakdown `{ posts, impressions, clicks }`
- variantClicks: per variantIndex click counts from events

The background worker performs a rollup shortly after UTC midnight (probabilistically to avoid contention) or when `FORCE_DAILY_ROLLUP=true`.

## Variant Selection Strategies
 
Environment variable `VARIANT_SELECTION_STRATEGY` controls how the next variant is chosen when multiple message variants are present:

- `rotation` (default): round-robin by historical post count
- `bandit`: UCB1 multi-armed bandit using clicks/post as reward, with exploration bonus `sqrt((2 * ln(totalPosts)) / posts)`

Overrides:
- Per-content: set `variant_strategy` field on the content document (e.g. `rotation` or `bandit`).
- User default: POST `/api/profile/defaults` with `{"variantStrategy":"bandit"}`; applied automatically on upload if content lacks `variant_strategy`.

Set in `.env`:

```
VARIANT_SELECTION_STRATEGY=bandit
```

Untried variants are forced early by assigning them a very high sentinel score ensuring initial exploration.

## Firebase Credential Diagnostic
Run the script to verify service account detection and perform a lightweight Firestore read:

```
node scripts/checkFirebaseCredentials.js
```

Supports JSON path, raw JSON, base64 JSON, or individual FIREBASE_* key fields.

## Notifications API (MVP)

Endpoints:
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/notifications` | List recent notifications (default 50, `?limit=` up to 100) |
| POST | `/api/notifications/:id/read` | Mark a single notification read |
| POST | `/api/notifications/read-all` | Mark all unread (≤200) notifications as read |

Notification documents (`notifications` collection) store: `user_id`, `type`, `title`, `message`, `created_at`, `read`.

## Profile Defaults API

Endpoints:
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/profile/defaults` | Fetch the user's current defaults |
| POST | `/api/profile/defaults` | Merge provided defaults |

Accepted fields (all optional):
`timezone` (e.g. `UTC`), `preferredPlatforms` (string[]), `postingWindow` ({ start:"HH:MM", end:"HH:MM", timezone? }), `maxDailyUploads` (number), `variantStrategy` (e.g. `bandit` / `rotation`).

Upload Auto-Enrichment:
- If no `schedule_hint` sent and a `postingWindow.start` exists, server sets next occurrence as a one-off schedule hint.
- If `variantStrategy` stored and content upload lacks `variant_strategy`, it is applied to the content document.

Schedule Preview:
`POST /api/profile/preview-schedule` -> `{ schedule: { when, frequency, timezone } }` (derives next run using stored postingWindow without creating content).

### Variant Strategy Stats (Admin)
`GET /api/admin/variants/strategy-stats` -> distribution of `variant_strategy` values over latest 1000 content documents.

### User Defaults Caching
Server caches `user_defaults` per user for `USER_DEFAULTS_CACHE_TTL_MS` (default 30000 ms) to reduce Firestore reads on heavy upload bursts.



1) Wire landing page + smart link generation into upload/approval and save to content doc
2) Add notifications MVP (Firestore collection, optional email) ✅ basic API
3) Add user profile defaults API and use for better schedule_hint generation ✅ initial implementation
4) Minimal admin UI screens for moderation and analytics
5) Promotion service naming cleanup (remove legacy artifacts)

## Quick Start (Prod-Like)
1. Set essential environment variables (.env or hosting platform):
	 - FIREBASE_* credentials OR GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS path
	 - ENABLE_BACKGROUND_JOBS=true
	 - VARIANT_SELECTION_STRATEGY=bandit
	 - EMAIL_PROVIDER=console (or sendgrid/mailgun + keys)
	 - BANDIT_TUNER_MIN_EVENTS=50
2. (Optional) Configure alerting via /api/admin/config/update:
```
{
	"alerting": {
		"webhookUrl": "https://ops.example.com/hooks/autopromote",
		"enabledEvents": ["exploration_drift","variant_diversity_low","bandit_manual_rollback","bandit_auto_rollback","email_delivery_failure"],
		"minDiversityRatio": 0.2
	}
}
```
3. Monitor `/api/admin/dashboard/overview` for initial system stabilization.
4. Adjust `banditExplorationTarget` if exploration too high/low once >200 selection events recorded.

## Rollback Procedure
Manual rollback to previous stable weights:
POST `/api/admin/bandit/rollback` { "strategy":"previous", "reason":"stability" }
Returns restored weights + emits alert & history doc.

## Alert Types
| Type | Severity | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| exploration_drift | warning | Exploration ratio outside tolerance * 2 |
| variant_diversity_low | warning | Active unique variants / total variants below threshold |
| bandit_auto_rollback | critical/warning | Automatic rollback after CTR drop |
| bandit_manual_rollback | warning | Manual rollback executed |
| email_delivery_failure | warning | Email provider send failed |
