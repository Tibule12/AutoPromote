# Login API Endpoint Fix

## Problem
The login endpoint was experiencing a 500 Internal Server Error because of a mismatch between what the client was sending and what the server was expecting.

## Changes Made

1. **authRoutes.js**: Updated the login endpoint to handle both authentication methods:
   - Token-based authentication (using Firebase idToken)
   - Direct email/password authentication

2. **App.js**: Modified the loginUser function to:
   - First try to authenticate with Firebase directly and get an ID token
   - Fall back to sending credentials directly to the backend if Firebase authentication fails

3. **firebaseConfig.js**: Updated to use ES modules syntax for client-side usage
   - Created a proper client-side configuration file

4. **LoginForm.js**: Created a standalone login form component with better error handling

5. **config/firebaseClient.js**: Added a dedicated client-side Firebase configuration 

6. **server.js**: Improved error handling to provide better error messages for common issues

7. **create-test-firebase-users.js**: Added a utility script to create test users in Firebase

## How to Test

1. Run the server:
   ```
   node server.js
   ```

2. Test login with a test user:
   ```
   email: testuser@example.com
   password: password123
   ```

3. Or create test users first:
   ```
   node create-test-firebase-users.js
   ```

## Documentation

Two new documentation files were created:
- FIREBASE_AUTH_SETUP.md: Guide for setting up Firebase Authentication
- DEBUG_LOGIN_ENDPOINT.md: Guide for debugging login issues

## Future Improvements

1. Add more robust error handling for specific Firebase error codes
2. Implement password reset functionality
3. Add multi-factor authentication support
