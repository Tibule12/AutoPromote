# AutoPromote Billing & Subscription Guide

This document outlines the billing, subscription, and payout flows within the AutoPromote platform. It is designed to provide transparency and clarity to all users regarding financial transactions.

## 1. Subscription & Billing (The "Billing Dashboard")

The **Billing Dashboard** is your control center for managing your AutoPromote subscription tier.

**Accessing the Dashboard:**

- Go to your **Profile** tab.
- Click the **"💳 Manage Subscription"** button.
- Alternatively, you can navigate directly via the "Billing" tab if visible.

**Features:**

- **Current Plan Status:** Shows your active plan (Free or Pro), renewal date, and billing amount.
- **Upgrade/Downgrade:** You can switch between "Free" and "Pro" tiers at any time.
- **Cancellation:** A "Cancel Subscription" button is available for all active paid subscriptions.
  - **Policy:** Cancellations are effective at the end of the current billing cycle. You retain access to Pro features until that date.
  - **No Refunds:** As stated in our Terms of Service, we do not offer refunds for partial billing periods once a charge has been processed, as access is granted immediately.
- **Payment Method:** All payments are securely processed via **PayPal**. We do not store your credit card information directly. PayFast is also supported for specific regions.

**Usage Limits:**

- The dashboard displays your current usage (e.g., Uploads, Viral Boosts) against your plan's limits.
- Upgrading to "Pro" often unlocks higher or unlimited allowances.

## 2. The Treasury (Earnings Dashboard)

The **Treasury** (formerly Earnings Panel) is where you track revenue generated from your content and referrals.

**How it Works:**

- **Accumulation:** Revenue accumulates in your "Pending Balance" as platforms (YouTube, etc.) report earnings and as referral commissions are confirmed.
- **Referral Commissions:** You earn **$5.00** for every active paid subscriber you refer. This is a one-time commission per successful conversion.
- **Payouts:**
  - You can request a payout once your "Available Balance" exceeds the minimum threshold (default: $50.00).
  - Payouts are processed manually by our administration team to ensure security and fraud prevention.
  - Payouts are sent to the **PayPal Email** or **PayFast Account** configured in your **Profile** settings.

**Fairness Guarantee:**

- We do not deduct hidden fees from your displayed balance.
- All potential earnings are clearly labeled as "Estimates" until confirmed by the respective platforms.

## 3. Rewards & Gamification (Rewards Dashboard)

This dashboard tracks your progress towards platform milestones.

**Policies:**

- **Viral Status:** Earning a "Viral Badge" is a status symbol and unlocks platform perks. It does **not** grant a direct cash bonus (updates have removed "Pay Per View" logic to ensure sustainability).
- **Referral Commissions:** As mentioned in the Treasury section, referrals earn real cash commissions, tracked here for transparency.

## 4. Dispute Resolution & Legal

**Transparency First:**

- We aim to be fully transparent about what you pay and what you earn.
- If you have a billing issue, please contact **thulani@autopromote.org** before opening a dispute. We are committed to resolving fair claims.

**Terms of Service:**

- By using our billing features, you agree to our standard [Terms of Service](/terms) and [Privacy Policy](/privacy).
- AutoPromote reserves the right to modify pricing with reasonable notice to active subscribers.
