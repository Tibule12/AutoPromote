# Compliance Phase‑1 Issues

This document tracks the Phase‑1 compliance issues created as templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`.

Created issues (templates):

- `compliance-001-kyc-spend-caps.md` — KYC + spend caps for brand accounts
- `compliance-002-compliance-logs.md` — `compliance_logs` collection and schema
- `compliance-003-creator-consent-ui.md` — Creator consent & UI disclosures
- `compliance-004-fraud-heuristics-review-queue.md` — Fraud heuristics + manual review queue

Next steps:
- Create real GitHub issues from these templates (link owners and milestones)
- Implement minimal PRs with feature flags and tests; include Legal sign-off in PR description using the PR template created
