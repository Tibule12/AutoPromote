TikTok Resubmission Checklist for AutoPromote

Purpose
This checklist helps you record a sandbox demo and resubmit your TikTok production review with a clear video and supporting evidence.

Before recording

1. Verify environment and deploy
- Confirm Render deployment is using the latest commit from `main`.
- Confirm Render environment variable `TIKTOK_SANDBOX_CLIENT_KEY` is set.
- Visit: https://autopromote.onrender.com/tiktok-demo and verify the "Sandbox Client ID" shows your client ID. If it shows "NOT SET", re-check the env var name and redeploy.

2. Verify app settings in TikTok Developer Portal
- App mode: Sandbox (for demo)
- Website URL: https://autopromote.onrender.com
- Redirect URI(s): https://autopromote.onrender.com/auth/tiktok/callback (and any variations you use)
- Scopes enabled: user.info.basic, video.upload, analytics.read (only include scopes demonstrated in the video)

3. Mock backend (optional, for local recording)
- If you want to simulate a token exchange or share responses locally, run the mock backend:
  - node src/mock/tiktok_share_backend.js
- For the local OAuth helper, open:
  - src/mock/tiktok_oauth_frontend.html

Recording the video (2-4 minutes recommended)

Follow the timestamps exactly, showing each step clearly. Narrate or annotate when helpful.

Submission notes (copy/paste into TikTok review)

Thank you for reviewing AutoPromote. We have configured Website URL and Redirect URI on the same domain (https://autopromote.onrender.com). This submission uses TikTok Sandbox for demonstration. The video shows:
- OAuth consent screen listing requested scopes (user.info.basic, video.upload, analytics.read)
- Code-to-token exchange and an example user profile call
- Uploading a sandbox video and showing the sandbox video id
- Fetching analytics for the sandbox video

If you require additional clips or an extended recording, please let us know.

Troubleshooting
- If https://autopromote.onrender.com/tiktok-demo shows "NOT SET": ensure Render env var name is exactly `TIKTOK_SANDBOX_CLIENT_KEY` and redeploy.
- If Redirect URIs differ, update them in the TikTok developer console and include the exact URIs in the video.
