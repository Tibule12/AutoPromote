# Content Upload and Fetch Flow Verification & Improvements

## Current Flow Analysis
- Frontend: Uploads files to Firebase Storage, sends metadata to backend API
- Backend: Stores metadata in Firestore, fetches content from Firestore
- Authentication: Uses Firebase Auth tokens

## Verification Steps
- [x] Verify Firebase Storage upload works correctly
- [x] Verify backend API endpoints authenticate properly
- [x] Verify Firestore CRUD operations work
- [x] Check for field name inconsistencies (userId vs user_id)
- [x] Test error handling in upload/fetch flows
- [x] Verify CORS and authentication headers

## Improvements Needed
- [x] Standardize field names between frontend and backend
- [x] Add comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- [x] Improve logging for debugging
- [x] Add validation for content data
- [x] Ensure consistent date handling
- [x] Add retry logic for failed uploads
- [x] Improve loading states and user feedback

## Implementation Steps
1. [x] Fix field name inconsistencies in contentController.js and contentRoutes.js
2. [x] Enhance error handling in frontend App.js upload function
3. [x] Add validation middleware for content uploads
4. [x] Improve logging in backend routes
5. [x] Add retry mechanism for failed Firebase Storage uploads
6. [x] Test the complete flow end-to-end
7. [x] Update documentation if needed
