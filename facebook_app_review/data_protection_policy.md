Data Protection and Third-Party Dependency Patch Policy

Scope
- Applies to AutoPromote server and frontend code and any mobile or web clients we own.
- Covers third-party libraries, SDKs, and platform dependencies (npm, PyPI, OS packages, mobile SDKs).

1. Identification
- We maintain dependency manifests (package.json / package-lock.json) for all JS projects. These manifests record explicit dependency names and versions.
- We run automated audits (npm audit) and review dependency vulnerability reports generated by CI or local scans.
- For mobile SDKs we include version numbers in release notes and in the repository documentation.

2. Prioritization
- We triage vulnerabilities using CVSS scores when available. Priority mapping:
  - Critical (CVSS >= 9.0): Patch immediately; aim to release a fix within 24-72 hours.
  - High (CVSS 7.0-8.9): Patch within 7 calendar days.
  - Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9): Patch within 30 calendar days.
  - Low (CVSS < 4.0): Address during the next planned maintenance window (within 90 days).
- When CVSS is not provided we use vendor severity and exploitability information to prioritize.

3. Patching and Release Process
- For direct dependencies, developers update version constraints in the manifest and create a pull request describing the update and the vulnerability fixed.
- Pull requests include: dependency name, old and new versions, source of the vulnerability report (npm audit, GH advisory), CVSS/severity, and test verification steps.
- Automated tests and smoke tests run in CI before merging. If CI is not available, a developer runs local tests and documents results in the PR.
- Release notes include dependency updates and CVE IDs where applicable.

4. Ongoing Activity
- We plan regular dependency review at least monthly to check for updates and advisories.
- Critical or exploitable vulnerabilities follow the expedited patch cadence described above.
- We maintain an internal changelog of security updates (in the repository) with dates and actions taken.

5. Roles and Responsibilities
- Developers: create and validate PRs for dependency upgrades and apply patches.
- Release/Lead: review and merge urgent security fixes and coordinate emergency releases.
- Project owner: maintain the review cadence and ensure security updates are recorded.

6. Evidence of Compliance
- Dependency manifests (package.json and package-lock.json) with version history in git.
- Pull requests and CI runs showing dependency update PRs.
- npm audit reports or other vulnerability scan outputs.
- Release notes or changelog entries with dates and CVE references.
