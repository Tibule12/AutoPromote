No Mobile App Processing of Facebook Platform Data â€” Statement

Project: AutoPromote
Date: 2025-10-21

Statement
- AutoPromote does not process Facebook Platform Data within any mobile application owned or published by our organization.
- All interactions with Facebook Platform Data (if any) occur on our backend servers or via web-based flows. We do not embed Facebook SDKs or perform Platform Data processing inside Android or iOS mobile clients.

Details
- Mobile clients: We do not publish or maintain a mobile (Android/iOS) application for AutoPromote that collects, stores, or processes Facebook Platform Data.
- Server-side integrations: Any Facebook Platform Data access (for example, server-to-server calls using access tokens) is performed on our servers under controlled processes.
- Third-party SDKs: Mobile SDKs for Facebook or other providers are not present in our mobile builds because we have no mobile apps.
