AutoPromote — App Review: Data Protection Bundle

Date: 2025-10-21
Project: AutoPromote

Purpose
- This single document bundles our concise statements, policies, and example evidence for Facebook App Review Data Protection questions (dependency patching, system/endpoint patching, and mobile-processing statement).

1) No mobile app processing statement

No Mobile App Processing of Facebook Platform Data — Statement
- AutoPromote does not process Facebook Platform Data within any mobile application owned or published by our organization.
- All interactions with Facebook Platform Data (if any) occur on our backend servers or via web-based flows. We do not embed Facebook SDKs or perform Platform Data processing inside Android or iOS mobile clients.

Details
- Mobile clients: We do not publish or maintain a mobile (Android/iOS) application for AutoPromote that collects, stores, or processes Facebook Platform Data.
- Server-side integrations: Any Facebook Platform Data access (for example, server-to-server calls using access tokens) is performed on our servers under controlled processes.
- Third-party SDKs: Mobile SDKs for Facebook or other providers are not present in our mobile builds because we have no mobile apps.

2) Dependency patch policy (third-party libraries)

Data Protection and Third-Party Dependency Patch Policy
- Scope: applies to AutoPromote server and frontend code and any mobile or web clients we own.

Identification
- We maintain dependency manifests (package.json / package-lock.json) for all JS projects and run automated audits (npm audit) and review vulnerability reports generated by CI or local scans.

Prioritization (CVSS mapping)
- Critical (CVSS >= 9.0): Patch within 24-72 hours.
- High (CVSS 7.0-8.9): Patch within 7 days.
- Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9): Patch within 30 days.
- Low (CVSS < 4.0): Address during the next maintenance window.

Patching Process
- Developers create PRs to update dependencies, include CVE/CVSS info, and run automated tests before merging.
- Release notes include dependency updates and CVE IDs where applicable.

Evidence (examples in this bundle)
- package.json / package-lock.json (repo manifests)
- npm audit output (example: `audit.json`)
- Example PR screenshot showing changed package.json lines and CI checks passing.

3) System & Endpoint patch policy

System & Endpoint Patch Policy — AutoPromote
- Scope: the policy covers operating systems, browsers, antivirus, and other endpoint software used by AutoPromote developers and operations staff.

Identification
- We maintain an inventory of critical hosts (workstations, CI runners, servers) with OS/version and last patched dates.

Prioritization and Cadence
- Critical: apply within 24-72 hours; High: within 7 days; Medium: within 30 days; Low: next maintenance window.

Patching Process
- Workstations: enable automatic OS and browser updates where possible.
- Antivirus: configured to update definitions automatically daily.
- Servers/CI: apply updates via automated playbooks and run smoke tests afterwards.

Evidence (examples in this bundle)
- `host_inventory_example.csv` — sample host inventory snapshot
- `server_patch_log_example.txt` — example patch log showing update commands and timestamps
- Screenshots (Windows Update, antivirus dashboard, browser About) — follow the screenshot and redaction instructions below.

4) Evidence files included (example templates)

Host inventory example (CSV):
```
Host,Role,OS,OS_Version,Last_Patched,Notes
dev-workstation-01,Developer workstation,Windows,10.0.19045,2025-10-15,Auto-updates enabled
ci-runner-01,CI runner,Ubuntu,22.04,2025-10-18,Patched via automated playbook
prod-server-01,Application server,Ubuntu,22.04,2025-10-18,Security-only updates applied nightly
ops-workstation-01,Operations workstation,macOS,13.6,2025-10-10,Auto-updates enabled
```

Server patch log example (text):
```
2025-10-18 02:10:12 UTC - apt-get update && apt-get -y upgrade
2025-10-18 02:10:45 UTC - Installed linux-image-5.15.0-88-generic
2025-10-18 02:10:46 UTC - Restarted kubelet service
2025-10-18 02:10:55 UTC - Ran CI smoke tests: all tests passed
```

5) Screenshot & redaction instructions (quick)
- Remove or blur hostnames, IPs, and credentials; keep timestamps and version numbers visible.
- Windows Update: capture "Last checked" or "Last updated" and the Windows version.
- Antivirus: capture definition update time and product version.
- Browser About: capture the version page showing "Updated" or the version number.
- Server logs: include short snippets with timestamps and commands; redact hostnames.

Notes & next steps
- If reviewers ask for additional evidence I can generate a zip of these files (`facebook_app_review/bundle_for_upload.zip`) or embed screenshots you provide into this bundle.
- Replace `security@yourdomain.example` and the project owner signature with real contact details before uploading.

End of bundle.
