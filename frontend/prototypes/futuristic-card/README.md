Futuristic Platform Card Prototype (2040)

Files:

- index.html — standalone demo page (open in browser)
- style.css — visual styles (glass, neon accents, parallax)
- script.js — hover parallax and motion controls

Open locally (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
start frontend\prototypes\futuristic-card\index.html
```

Notes:

- This is a standalone prototype for visual exploration. It does not modify the app.
- Accessibility: respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Next steps: integrate component into React app, connect live preview frames, and add keyboard interactions.
