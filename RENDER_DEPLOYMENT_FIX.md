# Deployment Fix for Render

## Issue Fixed

This commit fixes a deployment error on Render where the server failed to start due to a missing dependency:

```
Error: Cannot find module '@supabase/supabase-js'
```

## Changes Made

1. Created a Firebase-based compatibility layer in `supabaseClient.js` that handles any legacy code still referencing Supabase
2. The solution avoids adding a Supabase dependency, maintaining the Firebase-only approach

## How It Works

There appears to be some legacy code in the application that still references a `supabaseClient.js` file, even though the project now uses Firebase. Instead of adding a Supabase dependency, we've created a compatibility layer that:

1. Provides a dummy implementation of Supabase methods
2. Logs when these methods are called (to help identify legacy code)
3. Returns empty results that match the expected Supabase format (to avoid errors)

## Deployment Instructions

When deploying to Render, no special environment variables are needed for Supabase since we're using a Firebase-only approach.

The key Firebase environment variables to set in Render are:

- `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` 
- `FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL` 
- `FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
- `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` (the JSON service account file contents)

## Future Improvements

In the future, you may want to:

1. Identify any code still using the supabaseClient.js file (check the logs for "[Legacy Supabase]" messages)
2. Update those files to use Firebase directly
3. Remove the supabaseClient.js compatibility layer once all legacy code is updated
