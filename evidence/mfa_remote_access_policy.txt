AUTO-PROMOTE MFA & REMOTE ACCESS POLICY
Generated: {ISO_TIMESTAMP}

1. Overview
We enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and key-based access controls for every administrative path that could reach Meta Platform Data or deployment infrastructure. Direct server-level SSH access is intentionally disabled; privileged actions occur through providers (Render dashboard, Firebase console, GitHub) which require individual accounts with MFA enabled.

2. Administrative Access Channels
| Channel | Access Method | MFA Enforcement | Additional Controls |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Source Code (GitHub) | Web (2FA) / git over SSH | GitHub 2FA required on maintainer accounts | Protected branches; deploy key read-only; secrets excluded from repo |
| Deployment (Render) | Web dashboard | Render account 2FA enabled | No inbound SSH; build & deploy only via Git pulls / dashboard actions |
| Firebase / Firestore | Web console / Service Account | Google Account MFA (enforced) | Principle of least privilege service account; Firestore rules limit data paths |
| Monitoring & Logs | Dashboard / CLI (authenticated) | Same as above | Access logs & admin audit logs stored separately; analyzer alerts reviewed |
| Secrets Management | .env (not in repo) / provider config | Access gated by MFA at provider | Rotation on incident or quarterly |

3. SSH & Direct Host Access
- We do not expose port 22 publicly; remote shell access is disabled. Evidence screenshot shows connection attempts refused/timeout.
- All maintenance occurs via build pipeline and provider consoles with authenticated sessions and MFA.

4. MFA Enforcement Details
- GitHub: All admin accounts have 2FA; repository settings require 2FA for organization membership (screen provided separately).
- Render: 2FA enabled (TOTP); screenshot submitted with Meta review.
- Google/Firebase: Enforced via Google Account security policy; administrative users added only after confirming MFA.
- No shared accounts; each administrator has their own identity and revocation path.

5. SSH Key & Git Controls
- Deploy uses a read-only deploy key or HTTPS with a personal access token protected by 2FA/SSO.
- SSH keys are generated with ed25519 + strong passphrase; compromised keys are revoked immediately.
- Protected branches (main) require PR review; CI runs security/audit checks (npm audit, Snyk) before deploy.

6. Audit Logging & Correlation
- Administrative actions recorded in Firestore collection `admin_audit` (write-only for server code).
- Each record includes: actorUid, action, target, timestamp (ISO), IP, correlationId, status.
Sample (redacted):
{
  "at": "2025-11-07T16:35:12.351Z",
  "actorUid": "admin_12345",
  "action": "payout:approve",
  "target": "user_67890",
  "status": "success",
  "ip": "203.0.113.7",
  "correlationId": "7b2c7e7f-63f6-4d73-a5b4-6c0d2e7b2eaa"
}

7. Alerting & Incident Response
- Log analyzer flags brute-force login attempts, admin probing, and 5xx spikes; alerts reviewed by on-call.
- On suspected compromise: revoke tokens, rotate secrets, suspend affected admin account, review audit & access logs, notify security contact.
- SLA: triage within 30 minutes of high-severity alert; remediation actions initiated within 2 hours.

8. Onboarding / Offboarding Procedure
Onboarding:
  1. Verify candidate requires access (role justification).
  2. Enable MFA on GitHub + Render + Google before granting repo/org or project access.
  3. Provide principle-of-least-privilege role; log initial grant in admin audit.
Offboarding:
  1. Revoke GitHub org membership, Render team access, Firebase roles.
  2. Rotate any keys/secrets created by the user if not ephemeral.
  3. Verify recent admin audit entries for anomalies.

9. Risk Statement
The absence of direct SSH and universal MFA across provider boundaries significantly reduces risk of credential-based unauthorized access. Even if a password is compromised, second factor or key-based restriction prevents escalation. Admin actions are traceable and rate-limited.

10. Compliance Assertion
At generation time, all administrative channels require MFA; no password-only remote shell access exists; audit logging and alerting are active.

AUTO-PROMOTE — Remote Access to Servers (MFA) Evidence
Generated: {ISO_TIMESTAMP}

Position
- Production servers do not expose SSH (port 22) for remote logins. Remote shell access is disabled by policy; deployments occur via CI/CD only.
- Because SSH is disabled, “remote access to servers” requires MFA at the upstream providers where console actions can occur (GitHub, Render/Firebase/Google Cloud). Those providers enforce user MFA and access policies; no path exists to bypass MFA to reach a shell.

Controls
1) Network: Inbound port 22 is blocked; hosts do not accept SSH connections. Attempts to ssh to the production domain are refused/timeout (see attached PNG evidence).
2) Change management: All changes are delivered via Git commits and CI. Direct shell is not used. Admin credentials are not stored on developer machines.
3) Provider MFA: Organization accounts require MFA. All collaborators must have MFA enabled to access repositories, deployment pipelines, or the cloud console.
4) Principle of least privilege: CI deploy tokens are scoped; no broad shell permissions. Break-glass is documented but not enabled by default.

User MFA Statement
- All users who can impact servers (code, deploys, configuration) must have MFA enabled on their provider accounts. Access without MFA is not allowed.

Procedural Steps (how we enforce)
1) Disable SSH exposure at the platform layer (no public port 22; no bastion).
2) Enforce MFA on provider accounts (GitHub: require 2FA; Cloud/Render/Firebase: require 2-step verification; SSO if available).
3) Deploy via CI only; rotate tokens on join/leave; audit releases.
4) Quarterly review of provider user lists and MFA enforcement status.

Evidence Attachments

Declaration
- Remote SSH access is disabled. MFA is required for all privileged access that can impact servers via provider consoles or pipelines.
