AUTO-PROMOTE — Meta Clarifications Response
Generated: {ISO_TIMESTAMP}

Scope
This document answers Meta’s clarifying questions regarding (a) high/critical vulnerabilities from automated scans and (b) whether we collect admin audit logs in our backend environment, with a brief procedure.

Part A — Vulnerability Clarifications and Remediation Status

Summary
- Critical vulnerabilities affecting unauthorized access to Meta Platform Data: NONE detected.
- High vulnerabilities reported by tooling: addressed as follows (risk assessment + remediation):

1) axios — GHSA-4hjh-wcwx-xvwj (Potential DoS via unbounded payload)
   • Risk to Meta Platform Data: No unauthorized access risk. This advisory concerns availability (DoS), not confidentiality or auth bypass. Our use of axios is server-side for outbound API calls with timeouts and size limits at the HTTP layer (Express JSON/body size and reverse-proxy limits). Admin endpoints are authenticated and rate-limited.
   • Remediation: UPDATED. package.json now uses axios ^1.12.2 (>= 1.12.0 as per advisory guidance).

2) semver (transitive via simple-update-notifier) — GHSA-c2qf-rxjj-qqgw (ReDoS)
   • Risk to Meta Platform Data: No unauthorized access risk. ReDoS could impact availability, not authorization or data access.
   • Remediation: UPDATED. package.json declares overrides { "semver": "^7.6.0" } (>= 7.5.2 patched). Our dev tooling (nodemon) is not included in production builds/deploys. Override ensures non-vulnerable version is resolved across the tree.

3) nodemon → simple-update-notifier (dev-only)
   • Risk to Meta Platform Data: None in production (dev-only dependency; not deployed). ReDoS chain addressed by semver override above.
   • Remediation: UPDATED to nodemon ^3.x and governed by overrides; not used in production.

4) sharp / libwebp CVE-2023-4863 (from earlier scans)
   • Risk to Meta Platform Data: Not in active production path; image handling does not touch Meta tokens or Platform Data; the issue is a client-side libwebp bug not used in our runtime surface for Meta data processing.
   • Remediation: The dependency is not present in package.json; where present historically, it has been upgraded to >= 0.32.6 during rebuilds. We continue to keep it out of the deployed runtime for Meta integrations.

Cross-check
- Snyk test: No known vulnerabilities (see evidence/snyk_test_.json, "summary": "No known vulnerabilities").
- npm audit (evidence/npm-audit.json): prior high findings are addressed by versions/overrides above and by excluding dev-only modules from production.

Process Controls
- CI gate includes npm audit and dependency checks; Dependabot alerts are enabled. Findings are triaged within 24 hours, fixed or mitigated within SLA (Critical: 24h; High: 3–7 days). Production contains no dev-only tooling.

Conclusion (Part A)
- There are no critical or high vulnerabilities that provide a path to unauthorized access to Meta Platform Data. Availability-class issues were mitigated and dependencies are updated/pinned as noted. Remaining items (if any appear in future scans) will be handled within SLA.

Part B — Admin Audit Logs (Backend Environment)

Answer: YES — we collect admin audit logs for the backend environment.

What we log
- Actor and authentication: actorUid (admin), auth method, ip, userAgent
- Action and scope: action (e.g., setRole, payout:approve, config:update, cache:clear, task:replay), target (userId/docId), route or console origin
- Time and outcome: at (ISO), status (success|error), error detail (if any), correlationId/requestId

Where stored
- Firestore collection: admin_audit (write-once documents).
- Access is restricted to service accounts and security reviewers via IAM; not readable by general users.
- Retention: 180 days minimum (exportable on request); rotation policy ensures storage efficiency without losing required records.

How we protect it
- Firestore Security Rules deny client access to admin_audit; server-side writes with service credentials only.
- Logs include correlation IDs for cross-reference with access logs and incident timelines.
- Rate limits and auth checks prevent noise and brute attempts from polluting the audit trail.

How to export (evidence available)
- Script: scripts/exportAuditEvidence.js (filters by date range and action types).
- Optional filters: scripts/filterEvidence.js; suspicious patterns: scripts/detectSuspicious.js
- Output is a JSON/CSV bundle suitable for review.

Sample (redacted)
{
  "at": "2025-11-07T16:35:12.351Z",
  "actorUid": "admin_12345",
  "action": "config:update",
  "target": "system_settings",
  "status": "success",
  "ip": "203.0.113.7",
  "correlationId": "7b2c7e7f-63f6-4d73-a5b4-6c0d2e7b2eaa"
}

Operational Response
- Alerts from analyzer (scripts/analyze-logs.js) escalate to on-call; admins are required to review audit records for any elevated actions within the time window.
- Compromised accounts are locked; token rotation and OAuth revocation are performed per incident SOP.

Declaration
- To the best of our knowledge at submission time, production contains no unremediated high/critical vulnerabilities that would enable unauthorized access to Meta Platform Data. Admin audit logging is enabled and enforced as documented above.
